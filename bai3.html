	<h3>Pat tern matching with regul ar e xpressions</h3>
	<p>You may be familiar with searching for text by pressing ctrl -F and typing in the words you’re looking for. Regular expressions go one step further: They allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. You may not know a business’s exact phone number, but if you live in the United States or Canada, you know it will be three digits, followed by a hyphen, and then four more digits (and optionally, a three-digit area code at the start)</p>
	<p>Regular expressions are helpful, but not many non-programmers know about them even though most modern text editors and word pro-cessors, such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice, have find and find - and - replace features that can search based on regular expressions. Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers.</p>
